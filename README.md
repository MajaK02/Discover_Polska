<h1>Discover Polska</h1>

For this capstone project, the aim was to develop a full stack website built using the Django web framework. Discover Polska is a travel blog suitable for female or solo travellers wanting to explore locations in Poland, and read comments from other travelers to get their opinion or other useful advice regarding specific locations, cities or attractions.  This website provides users with; a blog with the top attractions in Poland, comments section, and about page for users to gin insight into who the writer is (I used myself in this case as I felt it was more authentic) and a contact us form, which encouraged users, other travellers or travel companies to get in contact in order to set up collaboration, share some more hidden locations to see and other requestes. 

With its current features and any future developments, the hope is that this travel blog will become a valuable travel tool for thise wanting to explore Poland or solo travel while showcasing modern web development techniques.

The website was built using Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, computer/laptop-based first, rather than mobile, however using Bootstrap ensured wide accessibility & responsiveness across various devices and platforms.

## User Expereince (UX)

### Objectives
* Create an engaging travel aid for travel enthusiasts who want to explore Poland
* Provide a user-friendly interface for finding information on travel locations
* Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes

### Target Audience
* Female or Solo travellers looking to explore more of Europe
* Users who are specifically wanting to explore more of Poland, including city breaks, historical monuments or nature. 
* Travel agencies/ companies who wish to get in contact to collaborate, offer funding for travel or users who want to suggest other locations not listed in the blog. 

### User Stories

GitHub Copilot provided useful suggestions for user stories, though some required adjustment to meet project goals.

The user stories for this project were taken from the Code Institute Code-Star blog project. Due to my limited experience and lack of confidence in using Python/Django, I chose to not go 'overboard' with my User Stories like in previous projects, becasue I did want to build the habit of maintaining agile methodology in using them and keeping on track. 

This prompt generated the necessary user stories applicable to our project design, and it was further clarified to include the must-have, shold-have and could-have MOSCoW labels. 

* As a user, I want to modify or delete a comment I made on a blog post
* As a user, I want to be able to register an account on the blog using an email or username. 
* As a user I can leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation
* As a user / Admin I can view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation
* As a user, I can view a paginated list of posts so that I can select which post I want to view.
* As a user, I want to be able to access the blog on any device (laptop or mobile).

    * whitenoise==5.3.0

This ensured the project was in line with the project requirements as set out by Code Institute but also ensured that the travel blog was responsive, functional and accessible to our target audience. 

### Database

- [PostgreSQL from Code Institute](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/ "link to postgresql from code institute") was used as the PostgreSQL database for this project. 

### AI

To further supplement the website design, I included the following AI technology and websites to aid in the creation of the initial design ideas and to debug any issues within the code.

* #### [Perplexity.ai](#https://www.perplexity.ai) 
* #### [Chat GPT](#https://chatgpt.com/)
* #### Co-pilot (Github)

Also, certain parts of the code were used from the CodeStar Blog walkthrough by Code Institute, to build the foundation of the project using Django (this is for the models i.e. Post, Comment and to ensure working CRUD functionality). The contact us form was developed from the walkthrough's Collaboration Form, however the contact us form was adapted as a custom model for this project, including additional, custom features relating to subject and destination.

## Database Schema

### Entity relationship Diagram
In the screenshot below, the ERD showcases that the User has a relationship to Post and Comment and Comment also has a relationship with both User and Post. 

![ERD](docs/readme_images/erd.png)

## Design 

### Wireframes

Prior to starting the project, I designed prospective wireframes using [Balsamiq](#https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to have an idea of the blog's design, layout and feature placement. Ultimately, depsite some minor changes, the project remained closely aligned with the inital wireframes. 

#### Laptop view
![Wireframe](docs/readme_images/wireframe.png)

<br>

#### Mobile view
![Wireframe](docs/readme_images/mobile_wireframe.png)

<br>

#### Tablet view
![Wireframe](docs/readme_images/tablet_wireframe.png)

### Color Palette & Color contrast 
 
The color scheme for this blog was inspired by a blog template from Wix, which inspired a nature-based color palette of green, cream/brown/gold. This was meant to inspire calmness, relaxation and for the user's eye to be drawn to the pictures on the blog posts. Using this approach was intended to not be overbearing on the user and not overwhelm with too many colors and information. 

The initial color palette from Coolers was Hazy Hues, with the exception of the font color. 

![Color palette](docs/readme_images/Hazy%20Hues.png)

The initial text color of choice was #C0895C however this resulted in a low WAVE score (low contrast), espcially for users with issues with vision. 

![colour contrast](docs/readme_images/contrast.png)

Therefore, it was changed to the initial color pallete from hazy hues. However, it is being kept for future developments, as an alternative if the green background color could be altered slightly to make the contrast more effective.

### Icons & Images
The logo for this project was intended to be memorable and inspiring calmness, and it was generated by the Wix free logo designer. The intended color scheme was checked alongside the initial Hazy Hues palette to see if it matches, and ultimately the green color was taken from the logo to make it seamless. 

![logo](docs/readme_images/logo.png)

## Features
### Logo and navigation bar

A responsive navigatoin bar is in place for this blog. While the website was desgined for a computer/laptop view first, it is responsive across mobile devices through a burger icon, which has a dropdown menu including 'Blog', 'About', and the 'logout/login/register' options respectively. This burger icon appears on tablet view too. 

Additionally the logo, when clicked, redirects the user back to the home page (esentially the blog). See screenshots below. 

#### Monitor navigation bar

![Monitor navbar](docs/readme_images/navbar.png)


### Hero image

For my hero image, I used a Bootstrap automatic carousel with 4 aesthetic images of natural locations in Poland. This was chosen in order to add more animation and 'liveliness' to the website, keeping the user engaged and interested. Slides 1 and 4 also have messages on the images to draw the eye and resonate with the users. 

![Hero image](docs/readme_images/hero_image.png)

### Django alert messages
Everytime a change is made, there is an alert message; whether that is logging in/ out, when the user makes, edits or deletes a comment there is an automatic message ('Your comment is awaiting approaval' etc. )

 ![Alert messages ](docs/readme_images/signed_out.png)
 ![Contact Us message](docs/readme_images/contact_message.png)

### Clear indication as to whether the user is logged in or out at all times
The base.html file is responsible for displaying a "You are logged in as username" or "You are not logged in" depending on the boolean state of authentication.
Below is a screenshot of when the user is logged in. 

 ![Logged in/out](docs/readme_images/logged_in.png)

### A list of blog posts
For ease of access, the user has a clear visual of all the blog posts; Individual blog posts are displayed under one another on mobile screens or 6 on each page on a laptop/desktop. Each blog post has an individual image to draw attention, the author and an excerpt of the blog post for user to get a quick gauge of whether it is of interest to them. 

 ![Blog list](docs/readme_images/blog_list.png)

### See an individual blog post in detail
When a blog title or excerpt is clicked the post detail.html is rendered displaying a default image that is on all pages (same in every blog post), but also a mast head underneath the hero image with the blog title, author and date of publishing. Underneath this is the entire blog text/content as well as a comment count, comments section and a form to add your own comment if you are a logged in user.

 ![Blog Post](docs/readme_images/blog_post.png)

### Pagination
Pagination makes a long list of blog posts more manageable for users. It is comprised of 'next' and 'prev' buttons as well as a count of the pages available to view. This is to make users aware of how many pages they will need to click through ahead of time, rather than having them click endlessly. Six blogs are shown per page on this website.

 ![Pagination](docs/readme_images/pagination.png)

### About page
The user does not need to be logged in to view the About Me page. It includes an image of a Polish location to link to the admin's polish heritage and refer to the point of the blog. The about content explains the origin of the author, the point of the blog (travel locations in Poland and advice) and encourages the user's independent exploration. 
Underneath this is a contact us form targeted at both travel agencies/ other bloggers and users to get in contact with thier own experiences or other locations they think are worth visiting in Poland. 

 ![About Page](docs/readme_images/about.png)

### Custom Model: Contact us form
This is located at the bottom of the about me page and any requests are also visible in the Django administration panel. This is my custom model of choice, the initial code basis was take from the CodeStar walthrough project, however for the purposes of this project, it was adapted to be a contact request form, with the users name, email, subject, message and destination (that they are referring to or are wanting to explore further). Only the name, message and email fields are mandatory due to communication purposes. 
 ![Contact Us From](docs/readme_images/custom_model.png)

### Sign in form
This is a crispy form that asks for username and password and offers a 'remember me' option for ease of access in the future. 
   ![Sign in Page](docs/readme_images/sign_in.png)


### Register form (Sign up)
![Sign up Page](docs/readme_images/sign_up.png)

### Sign out page
The signout page confirms the user's actions to sign out of the blog: 'Are you sure you would like to sign out?'
   ![Sign Out Page](docs/readme_images/sign_out.png)

   ### Quote
   This quote section is located underneath the hero image and before the blog list. It is designed to act as a break between the two sections so that the overall page does not look cluttered to the user. 

 ![Quote](docs/readme_images/quote.png)

## Deployment
The site was created using the Code Institute template and deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

* Install the gunicorn python package and create a file called 'Procfile' in the repo's root directory
* In the Procfile write 'web: gunicorn lunar_lists.wsgi'
* In settings.py add ".herokuapp.com" to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list
* In settings.py add 'https://*.herokuapp.com' to CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS list, git add, commit and push to github
* Navigate to the Heroku dashboard

Create a new Heroku app
* Give it a name and select the region 'Europe' Navigate to settings tab and scroll down to Config Vars
* Click 'Reveal Config Vars'
* Add the following keys: key = DATABASE_URL | value = (my secret database url) key = SECRET_KEY | value = (my secret key) Navigate to Deploy tab
* Connect to GitHub and select the repo 'lunar-lists'
* Scroll down to 'Manual deploy' and select the 'main' branch
* Click 'Deploy Branch'

The live website for this project can be found at: https://capstone-project-mk-6cfa95e93b99.herokuapp.com/


## Deployment

All code for this project was written in Visual Studio integrated development environment. Github was additionally used for version control and to keep track of any changes being committed & pushed into the protected main branch, and the application was deployed to heroku from Github. 

- **Platform:** Heroku, with the blog being created using the Code Institute Template. 

### Pre-deplyment procedure
- To ensure that Github and heroku are configruated correctly and make the deployment process successful, it's good practice to keep an updated requirements.txt file with the necessary installed python modules. 
- A Procfile is required to allow heroku deployment to be configured to a gunicorn web app.
- In settings.py configure the ALLOWED_HOSTS list to allow heroku access, alongsdie the localhost (usually you'd find this when first deploying the blog from Github onto the web), in the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost'].
- Ensure all the necessary static files and directories are configured correctly to allow heroku to open them on the web once deployed.
- All environment variables should be put in the env.py, including the database url, cloundinary url and secret key.
- With the env.py file, due to the confidential nature of the infomration, it should be placed in the gitignore file, meaning that it will not be pushed onto Github. Once a new environment is opened, it will not include this information. It's good practice to make a note of these and input it manually in the new workspace. 

- During production/ when working on the project, it is also good practice to disable the DEBUG mode [Set to False] in the production environment to enhance security. Once deploying the project, this should be changed to true to gather the staticfiles. 

### Deploying with Heroku
Once the project is setup, the steps to deply it from Heroku are as follows:
- Click the "create new app" button on heroku
- Create a unique name for the app
- Select region (Europe was selected for this project)
- Click "create app"
- Select the deployment method (github was used for this project)
- Search for the github repository name related to the project (It is good practice to keep the same name across Github & Heroku).
- Click connect
- There is an option to use manual deployment or automatic deployment. Make sure main branch is selected. Manual deployment was selected for this project.  
- In the settings tab select reveal config vars. Input the required hidden variables
- Select nodejs and python as the buildpack
- Deploy
- After the first deployment you will see a message saying "your app was successfully deployed" and there will be a "view" button to take you to your deployed application.

### PostgreSQL Database
This project utilised a Code Institute PostgreSQL Database (this is available only to CI students). CI students have a maximum limit of 8 databases and which are subject to deletion after 18 months. 

To obtain this PostgreSQL database, the following steps were required: 
- Sign-in to the CI LMS using the student email address. 
- Request a new PostgreSQL database link, which was sent to the email provided. 

### Forking the repository 
By forking a repository, we mkae a copy of the original source code/ project to alter or view. However any changes we make to this forked repository will not affect the original Github repository. 

To fork this repository: 
- Log in to your Github account and locate the desired Github repository. 
- At the top fo the repository, just above the 'Settings' button, locate the 'Fork' button. 
- Once clicked, a copy of the original repositroy should now appear in your personal Github account. 


### Cloning the repository 
To clone this repository, you should:
- Go to the GitHub repository
- Click the Code button near the top of the page
- Select 'HTTPS', 'SSH', or 'Github CLI', depending on how you would like to clone. 
- Click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory
- Type git clone and paste the URL ($ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY .)[Don't forget the . at the end in order to clone the project locally]
- Press enter to create your clone locally

## AI Implementation and Orchestration
Throught this capstone project, various AI tools were utilised to streamline development, testing and expand my creative options of enhancing the blog's aesthetic. 

### Code Creation
- Reflection: Having some minor experience utilising AI and knoweldge of what was expected to see within the code (particularly Python code), I knew that Copilot would be used quite generously to account for my beginner's knowledge - this included generating boilerplate code, shadow-text offerring reasonable coding suggestions i.e. for Django models and CRUD functionality suggestions. 
Using multi-step prompts llowed me to have complex code broken down into understandable chunks and improve my understanding of certain concepts - making me progressively more confident in exploring independent coding approaches or techniques. 

- It was reassuring having copilot to assist with code generation, because as a novice software developer, it  elt like being assisted by a senior developer/ colleague. Additionally, it offered me perspective on how to structure my prompts to recieve raosnable answers fo not only my particular query, but making it suitable for my current coding level. 

### Debugging
- Reflection: In terms of debugging, copilot, Chrome Devtool AI and perpelxity.Ai were all utilised to find and explain errors while offering reasonable solutions. For example, as mentionned in th testign section, for the Lighthouse score, AI offerred to explain what their feedback meant and how it could improved to increase the best practice scores. Likewise, any errors appearing within VS code could be explained using copilot. This was a very informative learning experience, as I learned common bugs or how to debug relevent issues as I went along. 
- AI's solutions were often very reasonable, simplifing complex issues/ concepts and making it understandable to a novice developer. Additionally, most of the solutions it suggested made it accessible to any other developer who may be working on the project in the future. 

### Performance & UX Optimization
- Reflection: Admittedly, I think UX optimisation and overall aesthetic were the areas in which AI was utilised most heavily. I had a lot of ideas and expectations on how I wanted the blog to look but lacked the knowledge of completing this. I used perplexity AI to initally provide some prospective color palettes to provide the blog vibe I wanted to go for alongside some support in Bootstrap styling. I had some issues with ensuring the blog was responsive across device sizes initially, with my posts aligning underneath each other on mobile. Copilot suggested small alterations which made the blog look professional and resonated with users through it's clean look and responsiveness. 

## Overall Impact & Assessment of use
- Overall, working with copilot and other AI programmes majorly streamlined my coding process, ensuring that any issues, errors or bugs could be handled effectively by myself, but also pushing my personal development through explaining why certain issues occurred. However, it is crucial to note that AI cannot be a replacement for human thought/ analysis. here were moments were the solutions being offerred were quite outlandish and overly complciated, even when the prompt specified that it should be appropriate for a junior software developer.  There were moments were the applied solutions contradicted existing code, and created additional errors which weren't present beforehand. 

- In summary, this experience highlighted which areas remain my weak spots, which areas I stil need to focus on and build in order to develop within software development, particularly when it comes to back-end coding. However, it also improved my problem-solving skills, and ability to critically analyse an issue to come up with a potential solution - putting it into copilot to then check if it is feasible.  Above all, this experience taught me how crucial clear articulation is in software design, but also to explore new technologies and design concepts. 


## Issues and Bugs
One of the key issue during development was Heroku deployment. Repeatedly an error would pop up when the project was deployed, regarding static files. Having troubleshooted using copilot, ensured all the files were in place by going back to the Code Star blog walthought from Code Institute, the error was resolved by installing the psycopg2-binary package rather than the psycopg2 package.  

## Testing Summary
- **Manual Testing:**
  - **Devices and Browsers Tested:** Windows (Chrome, Edge, Brave), Android (Samsung Galaxy), Iphone.
  - **Assistive Technologies:** Tested using Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools, with additional code validation and accessibility tested separately.
  - **Features Tested:** CRUD operations, user authentication/ admin access, responsive design, and accessibility features.
  - **Results:** All critical features, including accessibility checks, worked as expected. They all classified within acceptable boundaries despite minor issues. 

 ## Code Validation

Testing and validation of this blog were carried out throughout the course of the project. This included regular debugging and testing using the Dev Tools provided within Chrome Browser, utilizing Copilot & Perplexity alongside using validation testing to address any code lines which needed fixing.

### HTML W3C
No errors were returned when passing the HTML code through the official [W3C validator]. For this project however, rather than passing through the entire project link, it was necessary to copy and paste the HTML code from the deployed 'view page source', into the validator via direct text input.

This is due to the fact that most pages require user authentication and the HTML vlaidator would throw errors if only the URL was used. 

![HTML](docs/readme_images/html_test.png)

#### CSS validation

When passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](#https://jigsaw.w3.org/), the direct CSS code also returned no bugs or errors. 

![CSS](docs/readme_images/css_val.png)

#### Javascript 

The validation for the javascript used in this blog [in the fixtures/posts.json file] returned no issues, only messages regarding ES6 which for this project is acceptable. 


### Lighthouse testing
Initial lighthouse testing of the blog in Chrome Devtools revealed a 78% performance rating, which is quie low but this may be due to image sizing. In the initial lighthouse assessment, the score was even lower due to larger image sizes for the blog thumbnails/post images. To improve this, the images were compressed using Tinypng.com.

![Lighthouse](docs/readme_images/lighthouse.png)

However, after making some adjustments to the python file configurations (more detailed in the section below), the lighthouse rating for performance increased to 92%, making the blog overall a lot more accessible, responsive and thought-out. 

Unfortunately, the best practices ratign remained at 59% in both lighthouse reports, which, while still in the acceptable zone for lighthouse testing, still offers room for further improvement and adjustment in terms of aligning with modern website practices. 

However, I am still very happy about the 95% accessibility rating [still firmly in the 'green zone' for lighthouse], which means that it may recieve more consumer traffic due to being easy to use, accessible and still relatively quick in loading content. 

![Lighthouse](docs/readme_images/lighthouse_2.png)

#### Future adjustments to further improve performance
- For future interations of this project, the post images will be compressed further to assess their impact on the lighthouse score. 
- Having delved into the issues for the low rating, one key issue was the lack of HTTPS. There was an attempt to rectify this issue, however it does require a more in-depth knowledge of mixed contect, which I currently do not posses and am eager to rectify. 
- The use of third-party cookies was also flagged, however this appeared to be in relation to the use of cloudinary, which was introduced by Code Institute and is therefore asusmed to not be relevant to this project at this point in time. 

### WAVE Accessibility validation
When the project was put through the WAVE validation, it returned some contrast errors, alt-image errors and highlighted the repeatability of some of the links. The contrast was changed following a contrast checker revealed a low score for the intended color palette, all the images in my project had relevant alt-descriptors and the numbered pagination links were removed, leaving only the PREV and NEXT buttons.

However, there remains 1 issue and 1 warning for the final project, which includes a missing H1 tag and some unclear color on the pagination buttons. I utilized copilot to try to fix these issues, however they remain as small bugs to fix in the next iteration of working on this project.

![Wave](docs/readme_images/wave.png)

### CI Pep8 Linter 
All python code was tested using the [CI Python Linter](#https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). 

When initially testing the main settings.py, models.py and admin.py documents they returned some design errors (mainly white space errors) however these were corrected relatively quickly. However it was interesting to note that were some discrepancies between CI Python Linter (pep8's expectations) and co-pilots output when the error was questionned. 

When this testing was repeated on all following python files, the discrepencies were gradually reduced due to recieving initial PEP8 feedback, and recieving an explanation of the error and it's requirements from co-pilot in order to accurately integrate the necessary changes.

## Future Improvements 
When I work on this project in the future I intended to improve the styling options, improving on the Wave error of contrast colors for better visibility. Furthermore, I wish to improve the lighthouse score even more, therefore more time will be spent familiarising myself with what exactly the errors are referring to, as in some cases by limited knowledge and experience meant that more time was spent debugging than on the project itself. 
Additionally, I intend to include a interactive map (using Javascript most likely) on which users can click on the area they are interested in and the relevant blog posts will be shown. 

## Future Features
### Personable user profiles
- Users will be able to add profile images to create a personable and 'real' feel. 
- users will be able to create their own 'mini' about/profile pages so that other users can see were they have travelled to previously, what they have commented on/reviewed. 

### Direct Messaging 
- Users will be able to directly message other users to ask questions or clarification on any potential travel destinations. 

### Interactive Map with pinpoint locations
- An interactive map will be included with pinpointed locations which have been referenced by blog posts. Users will have the possibility to click the pin and recieve links to relevant blog posts. 
- It would also be ueful for the blog to bring into other Eastern European countries, or at least those neighbouring Poland itself for variation in location and activities. 

### Sub-categories of blog posts
- I would want to create filters with subcategories of what people were interested in i.e. Specific cafes in Krakow, museums in Warszaw etc. making the blog more comprehensive.
